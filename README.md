# Shoes_Web_Scrapping
The assignment goal is to basically make a script to scrape some data from the website assigned to you.

The Website assigned to you is: 
https://www.dsw.com/en/us/category/mens-shoes/N-1z141hwZ1z141ju 

The above url contains around 3740 shoes, we need to scrape data for all those shoes.
